Recognising the Critically Ill Child
Loi V-Ter, Mervin; Lim Kian Boon, Joel

Introduction

Children are often unable or unwilling to verbalise complaints. In addition, symptoms and
signs of sepsis or cardiopulmonary compromise are often vague and subtle in children.
The ability to assess and recognise an ill child early allows for timely interventions
and therapy, such as respiratory support, fluid resuscitation or early antibiotics to reverse
potentially life-threatening cardiopulmonary instability.

Anatomic and Physiological Considerations

Respiratory arrest is the most common cause of cardiopulmonary collapse in children.
This is largely because the paediatric respiratory system is ill-designed to cope with an
increased work of breathing. The reasons are multi-factorial and include a relatively
large tongue and floppy epiglottis, small airways with increased airway resistance, and
increased chest wall compliance due to a cartilaginous chest wall. Respiratory failure is
characterised by inadequate ventilation, insufficient oxygenation or both.
Cardiac output is a product of stroke volume and heart rate, and blood pressure is
a function of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance.
Circulatory shock is defined as the failure of the circulatory system to provide
oxygen and nutrients to meet tissue metabolic demands. Shock can be classified into
compensated, uncompensated or irreversible.
Compensatory mechanisms include tachycardia and increased systemic vascular
resistance in an effort to maintain cardiac output and perfusion pressure (blood pressure),
respectively. Decompensation occurs when these mechanisms fail and result in end-organ
hypoperfusion and hypotension. Untreated, shock states can rapidly deteriorate into
failure of multiple organ systems and lead to irreversible shock and death.
The pathophysiology of shock can be divided into distributive, hypovolaemic/
haemorrhagic, cardiogenic or obstructive. It is not unusual for one patient to have a
number of different pathophysiological patterns of shock, which can evolve depending
on the time-course of their disease.
Recognition of pre-shock states is important so that early goal-directed therapy can
be instituted. The regimen of resuscitation includes fluid boluses, airway intervention and
inotropic support. The key is early shock recognition and prompt action.

History

Functional status of the child is a simple but effective measure of how ill the child is.
Questions to ask include:
• Level of activity/play
• Conscious level/irritability
• Feeding/fluid intake
• Urine output
Red flags in the history include:
• High-pitched cry/inconsolable crying
• Grunting
• Cyanosis
• Apnoeic episodes
• Pallor, cool and clammy peripheries
• Shortness of breath or dyspnoea
• Acute change in mentation
• Focal seizures
• Bloody stool in a neonate
There should be a high index of suspicion in the very young or if there is a significant
medical history, such as:
• Maternal history of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection (for neonates)
• Congenital cardiac defects
• Primary immunodeficiency syndromes
• Chronic steroid usage
• Haematological-oncological disorders on active chemotherapy
• History of adreno-cortical deficiency, e.g. hypopituitarism, congenital adrenal
hyperplasia, hypothalamic or pituitary lesions

Vital Parameters

Hypotension is defined as systolic BP:
• <60 mmHg in a neonate
• <70 mmHg in infants (1–12 months)
• <70 mmHg + [2 x (Age in Years)] in children 1–10 years
• <90 mmHg in children older than 10 years
Mean arterial pressure can be calculated as {50 + [2 x (Age in Years)} mmHg.
There is significant inter-individual variability of pulse pressure (systolic minus
diastolic BP), increasing with age and generally ranging between 20 and 40 mmHg. A
widened pulse pressure is present in distributive shock. A narrow pulse pressure may
suggest hypovolaemic or cardiogenic shock.
Unexplained tachycardia may be one of the first signs of compensated shock.

Age

Physical Examination

Clinical states which can rapidly progress and are life-threatening include:
• Severe respiratory distress
• Cardiovascular instability/cardiogenic shock
• Sepsis/septic shock
• Severe dehydration
• Seizures/altered mental state
• Trauma
• Any organ failure, such as renal/hepatic failure
Learn to integrate the signs of an unwell child as no single sign is definitive. If there
are concerning features in the history and/or physical examination, consider the following:
• Admit for observation or transport patient to an appropriate care facility after
initial stabilisation.
• Call for senior help if there is evidence of severe respiratory distress, poor
perfusion and/or hypotension, obtundation/change in mentation, prolonged
seizure or cardiac arrhythmias.
• Activate the paediatric Emergency Code Team if there is imminent
cardiopulmonary arrest, severe respiratory compromise needing intubation, or
if there is difficulty stabilising the patient, e.g. difficult venous access, no response
to therapeutic interventions, potential difficult airway.

Investigations

• Blood glucose: Exclude hypoglycaemia or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) as a cause
for obtundation
• Blood gas analysis: Evaluate for metabolic or respiratory acidosis, sodium/
potassium/calcium derangements
• Full blood count, renal panel and group and crossmatch
• Imaging: Chest X-ray (CXR) to exclude pulmonary pathology, cardiomegaly.
Computed tomography (CT) of the head if there are concerns regarding
intracranial pathology.

Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
Loi V-Ter, Mervin; Lim Kian Boon, Joel

Introduction

In children, cardiopulmonary arrests are usually a result of progressive respiratory failure
or shock. While the survival of children with in-hospital cardiac arrests has improved
over the years, with recent local data showing 45.6% survival-to-discharge, survival of
children from out-of-hospital cardiac arrests remains poor (3.4%). Despite the improved
outcome of in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), a substantial proportion
of survivors have significant neurological deficits.
The provision of advanced paediatric life support usually takes place in a hospital
environment where multiple responders can be rapidly mobilised and are capable of
simultaneous actions. Important aspects of a successful resuscitation from cardiac
arrest include early high-quality chest compressions, early assisted ventilation and early
defibrillation (if indicated).

Assessment

• Recognition of cardiac arrest should take no more than 10 seconds.
• The absence or presence of a pulse is not a reliable determinant of cardiac
arrest; other determinants include unresponsiveness, gasping breaths and no
spontaneous respirations.
• If cardiac arrest has occurred, activate the Emergency Code Team.

Management (Infant <1 year, excluding newborns;
child 1–12 years; adolescents >12 years)
Airway/Breathing
•
•
•
•
•

Open airway by appropriate positioning of head.
Infant: Neutral head position
Child: Head tilt-chin lift
Jaw thrust for suspected cervical injury.
Clear the airway by brief suctioning of mouth and pharynx, if secretions are
present.
• Apply bag-mask ventilation with 100% oxygen (at least 15 L/min oxygen flow).

Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation

• Use an appropriately sized oropharyngeal airway only in the unconscious child.
(Measure the oropharyngeal airway length from incisors to angle of mandible.)
• Ensure correct mask size, tight seal between mask and face, and assess for
effectiveness of ventilation (saturations, chest rise, air entry) but avoid excessive
ventilation.
• Deliver each breath with an inspiratory time of about 1 s.
• Ventilation should be synchronised with chest compressions at 30 compressions
followed by 2 ventilations [i.e. 30:2 ratio] in un-intubated patients in cardiac arrest
[if >12 years old and/or only 1 rescuer]; 15:2 ratio if ≤12 years old and at least
two rescuers present. In intubated patients, ventilate asynchronously without
interrupting chest compressions (30/min for infants, 20/min for children and
10–12/min for adolescents).
• In a patient with a perfusing rhythm but absent or inadequate respiratory effort,
give rescue breathing (30/min for infants, 20/min for children and 12/min for
adolescents).

Circulation

• Place on cardiac monitor/defibrillator monitoring.
• Place the patient on a firm board and commence chest compressions if pulseless,
or heart rate <60/min in child with evidence of shock (see algorithm on “pulseless
arrest”).
• High-quality CPR requires chest compressions to be of appropriate depth and
rate, with complete chest recoil after each compression, minimal interruptions
to the chest compressions and avoidance of excessive ventilation. (If manpower
permits, it is a good practice to appoint a CPR coach to supervise and provide
feedback for CPR.)
• Use “two fingers” (lone rescuer) or “thumb encircling” technique for an infant,
placed 1 finger breadth below the intermammary line (lower half of sternum).
• Use the heel of 1–2 hands for an older child placed at the lower half of the sternum
in the midline.
• Push Hard: Depress at least a third of the Anterior-Posterior (AP) diameter of the
chest (target 3–4 cm for infants, 4–5 cm for children and 4–6 cm for adolescents).
• Push Fast: Chest compressions of at least 100–120/min.

Endotracheal Intubation

• Endotracheal intubation should be performed by an experienced doctor. (See
Appendix III “Useful Formulae” for endotracheal tube (ETT) size formula and
lengths.)
• Use of Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI) drugs (See Appendix III “Useful
Formulae”) facilitates emergency intubation and reduces the risk of complications
associated with intubation. RSI should be used only by trained, experienced
providers. Patients in cardiopulmonary arrest and/or deep coma do not need
RSI; otherwise, intubation should be preceded by oxygenation and RSI agents.
• RSI agents typically consist of an anaesthetic induction agent and a muscle
relaxant. Maintenance of oxygenation and ventilation by bag-valve-mask

ventilation should be effective before paralysis is instituted. Use paralytic and
sedative agents with caution in a patient with a difficult airway as sedating and
paralysing such patients may render bag-mask ventilation more challenging.
Plan ahead and consider early escalation to a more experienced provider.
• Both cuffed and uncuffed ETT may be used in infants and children. If cuffed tubes
are used, cuff inflating pressures should be monitored and limited according to
manufacturer’s guidelines. Uncuffed ETTs are recommended for neonates.
• Indications for cuffed ETTs include large ETT leak, poor lung compliance and
high airway resistance.
• Use both clinical assessment and confirmatory devices (where available) to verify
correct ETT placement.

Indications for Intubation

• Severe airway obstruction
• Airway protection in the presence of poor/absent airway reflexes, e.g. decreased
conscious level, prolonged seizures, abnormal brainstem function, bulbar/
pseudobulbar palsy
• Apnoea or ineffective respiratory drive
• Respiratory failure not responding to or not suitable for non-invasive ventilation
• To assist with airway toileting

Vascular Access

• To obtain two large bore intravenous access for resuscitation. This attempt should
take no longer than 60–90 sec.
• Intraosseous (IO) access into the anterior tibial bone marrow (about 1–3 cm
below and medial to the tibial tuberosity) can be used if venous access is difficult.
All intravenous medications/blood products can be given intraosseously.
• The endotracheal (ET) route can be used to give lipid-soluble emergency drugs
(LEAN-lignocaine, epinephrine/adrenaline, atropine, naloxone) followed by a
flush of 5 ml normal saline and five manual ventilations. Optimal ET drug doses
are unknown, the general consensus is double or triple the dose of lignocaine,
atropine or naloxone. For adrenaline, an ET dose ten times the intravenous dose
(0.1 ml/kg of 1:1000 concentration) is recommended.
• Central venous cannulation or a venous cutdown may be performed if expertise
is available.
• Drugs and fluids (See Appendix II — Drugs [Cardiovascular]). Use isotonic
crystalloids as initial fluid for shock/fluid resuscitation. Give aliquots of 20 ml/kg
boluses and assess for response.
• There is no added benefit to using colloids during early resuscitative efforts, and
there is an associated risk of mortality with the use of colloids for resuscitation
in children with trauma, burns or traumatic brain injury.
• Routine use of sodium bicarbonate is not recommended in cardiac arrest.
It may be administered for treatment of tricyclic antidepressant overdose or
hyperkalaemia.

• Routine use of calcium is not recommended for paediatric cardiopulmonary
arrest in the absence of documented hypocalcaemia, calcium channel blocker
overdose, hypermagnesaemia or hyperkalaemia.

Gastric Insufflation

• Insert a nasogastric tube if abdominal distension is marked and/or oxygenation
and ventilation are compromised.
• Pass the tube after intubation as it may interfere with gastroesophageal sphincter
function, increasing risk of aspiration during intubation

Termination of Resuscitative Efforts

• Details of events and treatment must be recorded. Where there is no response
after 20 minutes of adequate resuscitation, the senior doctor should decide how
much longer resuscitative efforts should continue.

Special Resuscitative Conditions
Ventilation with a Tracheostomy

• Use the tracheostomy tube for assisted ventilation and watch for adequate chest
rise.
• If the tracheostomy tube does not allow effective ventilation even after suctioning,
change it.
• If still unable to maintain effective ventilation, attempt alternative ventilation
methods such as bag-mask ventilation through the nose and mouth while
occluding the tracheal stoma.

Drug Overdose and Poisoning
Tan Shi Rui, Victoria; Lim Kae Shin; Ong Yong-Kwang, Gene

Epidemiology

There is usually a bimodal age peak distribution for paediatric poisoning. The first peak
includes younger children (<6 years old) and the second peak includes the adolescents
(>12 years old).
Toddler toxicology is usually unintentional ingestion of pharmacological and nonpharmacological products and mostly benign due to the small quantities involved.

General Approach

The general approach to the poisoned patient can be summarised as stabilisation, history,
examination, diagnosis, decontamination and enhanced elimination, poison-specific
treatment and disposition (Figure 1.1).

Stabilisation

Stabilisation is priority in managing toxic ingestion. The patient should be rapidly
assessed to determine patency of airway and adequacy of ventilation, mental status
and cardiovascular stability. Correction of any associated hypoxia and hypoglycaemia
is crucial. Initial management priorities are maintenance and protection of the airway,
supporting ventilation and circulation. Unstable patients should be placed on a cardiac
monitor with measurement of vital signs every 5 to 15 min until the patient is stabilised.
The potential for rapid changes in the patient’s condition should be considered in making
decisions about airway and ventilatory support.
With regard to toxicology, prolonged resuscitation should be attempted in druginduced cardiac arrest. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be
considered if resources and expertise allow.

History

• History and physical examination are performed concurrently with stabilisation.
• History should include
Who: Patient characteristics, age, weight, relationship to others present and gender
What: 	Name and dosage of medication(s) or substance(s) of abuse, co-ingestants
and amount ingested
When: 	Timing and date of ingestion

No further distribution is allowed.

Where: Route which toxins was taken
Why: 	Whether intentional or accidental and associated details
• For paediatric ingestions, thorough history from caregivers is crucial.
• If the toxic ingestion is unwitnessed (time, dose), always manage as for worstcase scenario even if the patient is asymptomatic, especially if the alleged drug
is highly toxic.

• Other important historical points from the caregivers include a systemic review,
specifically the presence of seizures, agitation, coma, vomiting, headache and
shortness of breath.
• Clinicians should be aware that in some cases, the history may be unreliable for
teenagers, especially if the toxic ingestion was intentional or if there was ongoing
inappropriate substance use. Patients may not know what they ingested, the
patient’s altered mental status may impede communication, or the patient may
intentionally mislead the clinician.

Clinical Examination

• A thorough physical examination should be performed to help with the diagnosis
and identify complications.
• Specific attention to vital signs, mental status (depressed or agitated), respiration
(depressed, evidence of pulmonary oedema or aspiration), pupils (size, reactivity,
presence of nystagmus), skin (diaphoresis or abnormally dry, blisters), bowel
sounds (increased or decreased).
• Based on findings from physical examination, the clinician should specifically
consider the presence of a toxidrome.
• Note that for young paediatric patients, the classical findings may be different
from adolescents and adults. For example, for organophosphate poisoning
in young children, nicotinic symptoms may predominate over muscarinic
symptoms, and they may present predominantly with muscle weakness with
respiratory insufficiency, altered mental status and seizures. The pupils of the
organophosphate poisoned young child may not exhibit the classical miosis.

Decontamination

After the patient is stabilised, consideration should be given to removing the toxin. The
choice of decontamination should be made based on the clinical status and the suspected
toxin. Patients with an inhalation exposure should be removed from the source, with
care taken to avoid exposure of the rescuers. When toxic compounds have been splashed
into the eyes or onto the skin, copious irrigation should be performed.

Paediatric Gastrointestinal Decontamination

1. Single-dose activated charcoal
The preferred method of GI decontamination. It is indicated as a gastric decontaminant agent
if a patient has ingested a potentially toxic amount of a poison up to 1 hour following ingestion.
However, it can be considered for paracetamol toxic ingestion up to 2 hours.
Other toxins for which delayed administration can be given include aspirin, digoxin,
phenobarbitone, anticholinergics, tricyclics and sustained release tablets.
Dose: 1 g/kg (maximum of 50 g if less than 12 years old).
Drugs which are not absorbable by charcoal — PHAILS: Pesticides, Hydrocarbons,
Acids/Alkalis, Iron, Lithium and Solvents.
Activated charcoal is contraindicated in patients who are unable to protect their
airway. The use of orogastric and nasogastric tubes for administration of activated charcoal

in a drowsy or vomiting patient has been associated with pulmonary complications,
unless the airway has been secured.
2. Whole bowel irrigation
Whole bowel irrigation (WBI) is not routinely performed in the management of the
poisoned patient. WBI is best used in patients who are not vomiting and have normal
intestinal function. They are useful in patients with ingestions of highly toxic substances
that are poorly bound to activated charcoal, such as iron, lithium or lead, as well as for
sustained-release medications (e.g. certain formulations of lithium, theophylline or
calcium channel blockers).
WBI is contraindicated in patients with bowel obstruction, gastric haemorrhage,
perforation and ileus. It is also contraindicated in unstable patients or inpatients with
compromised unprotected airways, haemodynamic instability and intractable vomiting.
The procedure is administered by giving polyethylene glycol bowel preparation at a
rate of 1 to 2 L/h in adolescents and 500 ml/h in children through a nasogastric tube, to
induce osmotic diarrhoea till rectal effluent is clear (usually about 6 hours). The electrolytes
of small children must be closely monitored. For radio-opaque compounds (CHIPES:
chloral hydrate, heavy metals, iron, phenothiazines, enteric-coated tablets, salicylates/
substances in containers, e.g. body packers), continue until repeat radiographs are clear.
3. Gastric lavage
Gastric lavage is not routinely performed in the management of poisoned patients. In
certain cases where the procedure is of attractive theoretical benefit (e.g. recent ingestion
of a very toxic substance within 1 hour), the substantial risks should be weighed carefully
against the sparse evidence that the procedure is of any benefit.

Enhanced Elimination

Enhanced elimination techniques aim to increase the rate of removal of an agent from
the body with the aim of reducing the severity and duration of clinical intoxication.
Enhanced elimination techniques are only indicated for poisonings when
the following requirements are met: severe toxicity, poor outcome despite good
supportive care/antidote administration, slow endogenous rates of elimination, suitable
pharmacokinetic properties, benefit exceeds risks, and will not distract from other
priorities (e.g. resuscitation, supportive care, decontamination and antidote therapy).
Techniques for enhanced elimination include:
1. Multiple-dose activated charcoal (MDAC)
• This causes interruption of entero-hepatic circulation and gastrointestinal dialysis
for small, lipid soluble molecule drugs with a small volume of distribution and
low protein binding.
• Drugs (ABCD): Antimalarials (quinine), Aminophylline (theophylline),
Barbiturates, Carbamazepine, Dapsone.
• Contraindications: decreased consciousness/anticipated decreased level of
consciousness without prior airway protection, bowel obstruction.
• Give an initial dose of activated charcoal 1 g/kg (children) or 50 g (adolescents) and
repeat doses of 0.25 g/kg/h (paediatrics) or 12.5 g/h in divided doses over 2–4 hours.

• Check bowel sounds prior to administration of each dose and reconsider the
indications and clinical endpoints for therapy every 6 hours. Multiple-dose
activated charcoal should rarely be required beyond 6 hours.
• Complications include emesis (30%), charcoal aspiration, constipation, charcoal
bezoar formation, bowel obstruction, bowel perforation (rare) and corneal
abrasions. MDAC also risks distracting manpower from resuscitation and
supportive care priorities.
2. Urinary alkalinisation
• Urinary alkalinisation enhances renal elimination of weak acids such as
salicylates, phenobarbital and chlorpropamide.
• Loading dose of IV sodium bicarbonate 1–2 mmol/kg followed by infusing
bicarbonate-containing fluids: 3 ampules (150 mmol) of sodium bicarbonate to
1 L of dextrose 5% and run at 250 ml/h (run the IV at 1.5 times maintenance in
children).
• Achieving urinary alkalinisation is impossible if there is total body potassium
depletion, even in the presence of normal potassium levels on the renal panel.
Potassium supplementation is required.
• Follow urinary pH hourly. Blood pH, salicylate levels and electrolytes should be
monitored regularly. The frequency of monitoring is dependent upon the severity
of the clinical situation
• The goal is to achieve urine pH of 7.5–8.5.
3.	Extracorporeal elimination (e.g. haemodialysis, haemofiltration, haemoperfusion,
plasmapheresis and exchange transfusion)
• Effectively enhances elimination of any drug that is a small molecule, has a
small volume of distribution, rapid redistribution from tissues and plasma and
slow endogenous elimination. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)
has lower drug clearance per unit of time but slow continuous removal may be
preferred when the patient is haemodynamically unstable (unable to tolerate
rapid solute and fluid loss), the drugs are highly protein/tissue bound toxicant
with large volume of distribution with very long plasma half-lives and exhibit
‘rebound’ phenomenon (e.g. lithium)
• Indications for haemodialysis/haemofiltration are: carbamazepine (if MDAC is
inadequate or infeasible), valproate, lithium, concomitant severe hyperkalaemia,
metformin lactic acidosis, methotrexate (if in acute renal failure or leucovorin is
not available), paraquat (within 2 hours of ingestion), salicylates, toxic alcohols
and theophylline.
• Exchange transfusion can be considered for severe drug-induced
methaemoglobinaemia, or if refractory to IV methylene blue and IV ascorbic
acid, if antidote is contraindicated (e.g. methylene blue in G6PD deficiency) or
antidotes are unavailable.

Antidotes

• Antidotes are typically given after stabilisation and when the diagnosis was made.

No further distribution is allowed.

• In certain cases, prompt administration of antidote is imperative. E.g. prompt
administration of naloxone may avoid the need for endotracheal intubation in
opiate overdose.

Investigations

In general, toxicological testing can serve a number of purposes including:
• Confirming a toxic aetiology and avoiding the need for further diagnostic studies
• Identifying a specific agent
• Assessing the severity of the intoxication
• Assessing efficacy of treatment
• Guiding management decisions
• Prognostication
• Guiding transfer decisions

Disposition

Consider transfer to higher centre in the following circumstances:
• Inability to stabilise patient or deteriorating patient
• Inability to provide patient with ongoing maintenance treatment
• Lack of availability of toxin-specific therapy
• Management and disposition of patients following decontamination is toxin
and patient-specific, e.g. interventions such as dialysis, haemodialysis and
haemoperfusion.
• All patients who have taken a suicidal ingestion require assessment of suicidal
risk prior to discharge, possibly transferring to Institute of Mental Health if still
actively suicidal.

Pre-Hospital Paediatric Toxicology — Advice to Caregivers
Primary Prevention

Most poisonings occur when parents or caregivers are home but children may not be
supervised.
Advise caregivers to store medicine, cleaning and laundry products, paints/varnishes
and pesticides in their original packaging in locked cabinets or containers, out of sight
and reach of children.

Caregivers should never refer to medicine as “candy” or other appealing names.One
should be reminded not to give or take medication in the dark. They should also check
the label each time a child is given medicine to ensure proper dosage as the same drug
may come in different concentrations.

Home Management if Toxic Exposure has Occurred

If a child is unconscious, not breathing, or having convulsions or seizures due to poison
contact or ingestion, they should be advised to call for emergency services immediately.
Caregivers or any one nearby should initiate basic life support if they are able to.

Immediate Management for Home Poisonings

• Toxic ingestion — Advise the caregivers to immediately remove the item away
from the child and have the child spit out any remaining substance. Do not
induce vomiting or use syrup of ipecac.
• Skin exposures — Remove the child’s clothes and rinse the skin with lukewarm
water for at least 15 minutes.
• Ocular exposures — Flush the child’s eye by holding the eyelid open and pouring
a steady stream of room temperature water into the inner corner for 15 minutes.
• Inhalation exposures — The child should be evacuated outside or into fresh
air immediately. If respiratory effort is compromised, start cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) and do not stop until the child breathes on his or her own
or until someone takes over.

Clinical Presentations
Drug-Induced Bradycardia and Hypotension

• Paediatric advanced life support
» Perform CPR if despite adequate oxygenation and ventilation heart rate <60/
min with poor perfusion
• Treat reversible causes like hypoxia, electrolyte disturbances
• IV fluids
• Inotropic support
• Atropine
• External or internal cardiac pacing
• Resuscitative Extra-Corporeal Life Support (ECMO)

Drug-Induced Seizures

• The priority still is the management of reversible causes of seizures like hypoxia,
hypoglycaemia, electrolyte disturbances and if the history and physical findings
are not consistent with toxic seizures, intracranial infections, bleeds, space
occupying lesions should be appropriately excluded.

• Toxic seizures are often transient and no specific treatment is required. However
close monitoring may be required depending on the half-life of the ingested toxin
and other potential life-threatening conditions, e.g. arrhythmias.
• Benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam or lorazepam) are usually effective for toxic
seizures.
• If benzodiazepines are ineffective, barbiturates such as phenobarbital usually
will suffice.
• Phenytoin has no role in toxin-induced seizures and is theoretically harmful in
poisoning with substances with sodium channel blockade such as tricyclics. It
is also contraindicated in theophylline-induced seizures as it worsens toxicity.
• Pyridoxine may be required only in unusual poisonings such as isoniazid
toxicity.
• It is essential that the patients who have or had toxic seizures to be on cardiac
monitoring and have a 12-lead ECG performed.

Drug-Induced Altered Mental Status

• Treatment of the most common causes of altered mental status that can be
recognised and treated immediately.
• Exclude reversible causes like hypoxia, hypoglycaemia, electrolyte disturbances,
sepsis, intracranial pathologies.

paracetamol ingested in the last >24–72H. (if repeated dosing ≤24 hours, to
follow Acute Ingestion pathway)
		 In symptomatic patients — irrespective of dose, if ≥daily therapeutic dose
per day for more than 48 hours.
		 In asymptomatic patients — cumulative dose of ≥10 g or ≥200 mg/kg
(whichever is lesser) within a 24 hour period; or ingestion of ≥4 g/24 hours or
≥100 mg/kg/24 hours beyond 24 hours.

The Baby Bear Book

For acute ingestions, refer to the Rumack–Matthew nomogram
Liver function test (LFT):
• Transaminases (ALT, AST) begin to rise by 12 hours and peak at 72 to 96 hours
• Serum bilirubin (SB) rises more slowly
• Prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalised Ratio (INR) abnormal by
24 to 36 hours
Other investigations: Renal panel/electrolytes, blood gas

Treatment

Activated charcoal 1 g/kg (most useful within 2 hours of ingestion).
Specific antidote: IV N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC)
NAC is indicated if:
• Serum paracetamol level lies above the Treatment Nomogram Line on the
Rumack–Matthew nomogram (“Probable Toxicity”) for acute ingestion
• Asymptomatic with delayed presentation: ≥200 mg/kg or 10 g of paracetamol has
been ingested and serum paracetamol level is not likely available within the 8-hour
window. Effectiveness depends on initiation of NAC with maximal benefit within
8–10 hours of acute ingestion, diminishing value after 12–16 hours. If paracetamol
levels can be made known within 8 hours, need not start till levels are available.
• Symptomatic — unusual for symptoms to occur if ingestion is less than
8 hours (inaccurate timing or dose reporting).
• Sustained-release (SR) preparation or co-ingestion of agents which affect gastric
motility. In such cases, start IV NAC and follow RSTI workflow

Dosage of N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC)

For paracetamol poisoning, a total dose of NAC 300 mg/kg body weight was administered
over 3 phases traditionally. The current recommended regimen is a 2-bag IV NAC over
20 hours. Reported benefits of this 2-bag regime include significantly reduced non-immune
mediated allergic reactions, and it has been shown to be as effective as the 3-bag regimen.
This involves combining the first 2 bags of the traditional 3-course NAC infusion
into the loading dose. i.e.
• 1st bag is 200 mg/kg in TOTAL 500 ml (maximum concentration of 22 g over
4 hours, then followed by
• 2nd bag 100 mg/kg over 16 hours.
Please refer to your institution’s guidelines for IV NAC infusion and dilution charts
for details.
Similar to the 3-bag regimen, the last dose may be repeated if there is ongoing
hepatotoxicity. If the initial paracetamol concentration is more than double the
nomogram line following acute ingestion, increase NAC dose to 200 mg/kg over
16 hours.
The administration of N-acetyl-cysteine will be dependent on the child’s weight for
dosing and dilution.
• Phase 1: 200 mg/kg over ≈4 hours
» ≤25 kg: Add IV NAC 200 mg/kg in total volume of 100 ml
» >25–80 kg: Add IV NAC 200 mg/kg to 500 ml

Total duration: ≈20 hours
In all cases, additional maintenance fluids can be given if required, or NAC may
be administered in larger volume bags if more convenient. At 18 hours into the NAC
infusion (2 hours before completion), send bloods for:
• Paracetamol level
• ALT
• Urea, electrolytes, creatinine (5% of patients with paracetamol toxicity will
develop acute renal injury)
The NAC infusion should be discontinued only once the:
• ALT < 50U/L, reached their peak levels and are declining

• Urea, electrolytes and creatinine are normal or have normalised (if previously
abnormal)
• Paracetamol level has returned to normal (i.e. below <10 mg/dL)

Other Considerations

1) Massive Paracetamol ingestion and its management
Massive paracetamol ingestion is defined by ingestion of ≥30 g or ≥500 mg/kg (whichever
is less). Patients should receive IV NAC till completion and increased doses may be needed.
Consult clinical toxicologists and intensive care specialists early for further management.
Patients may be symptomatic early and present with severe lactic acidosis with or without
liver injury (direct effects on mitochondria).
In addition to the standard paracetamol management, if the patient is
haemodynamically unstable and with concerns of end-organ dysfunction or refractory

acidosis not responsive to standard resuscitation, consider haemodialysis early. If
haemodialysis is needed, IV NAC dosing may need to be adjusted (consult pharmacists/
toxicologists).
Complete IV NAC 2-bag regimen but increased doses needed for the 2nd bag.
If serum paracetamol at 4-hour post ingestion is:
• 2X probable toxicity, i.e. levels are ~300 mg/dL at 4H post ingestion, double the
2nd bag to 200 mg/kg over 16 hours.
• 3X probable toxicity, i.e. levels are ~450 mg/dL at 4H post ingestion, triple the
2nd bag to 300 mg/kg over 16 hours (consult pharmacists/toxicologists)
		 Repeat paracetamol levels 4H apart to guide need for further decontamination
(stat dose of activated charcoal) and IV NAC dose.
At 18 hours into the NAC infusion (2 hours before completion), send bloods for:
Paracetamol level, ALT, and Urea, electrolytes, creatinine.
The NAC infusion should be discontinued only when the:
• ALT < 50U/L, reached their peak levels and are declining
• Urea, electrolytes and creatinine are normal or have normalised (if previously
abnormal)
• Paracetamol level has returned to normal (i.e. below <10 mg/dL)
The 2nd bag over 16H may be repeated if there is ongoing hepatotoxicity at
completion of IV NAC at 20 hours and dosing adjusted to serum paracetamol (should
be <10 mg/dL at 20H).

Refer Gastroenterologists for review and possible need for liver transplant if liver
injury is refractory to management.
2)	Acute ingestion of Modified-Release paracetamol or co-ingestion of drugs that
significant slow GI transit.
Dose of modified release preparation ingested
i) If ingestion is <10 g or <200 mg/kg (whichever is less), i.e. non-toxic dose.
• If ≤4 hours post ingestion, administer activated charcoal, obtain bloods at
4 hours post ingestion.
• If presentation is >4 hours post ingestion, activated charcoal is not required.
Obtain bloods for ALT, renal panel and paracetamol levels.
• If ingestion occurred close to 8 hours post ingestion with concerns of toxic
ingestion to start IV NAC (2-bag standard dosing).
ii) If ingestion is ≥10 g or ≥200 mg/kg (whichever is less)
• If ≤4 hours post ingestion, administer activated charcoal if no contradictions
(e.g. ileus) and start IV NAC. Obtain bloods at 4-hour post ingestion.
• If presentation is >4 hours post ingestion, obtain bloods for ALT, renal panel and
paracetamol levels and commence IV NAC (2-bag standard dosing). Measure 2
paracetamol concentrations: (i) at least 4 hours post-ingestion and (ii) 4 hours apart.
» If either serum paracetamol levels are ≥150 mg/dL at 4H line (possible
hepatotoxicity), to complete IV NAC (2-bag standard dosing). If serum
paracetamol levels are increasing, consider stat dose activated charcoal and
serum levels and ALT re-assessed as needed.
» If either serum paracetamol levels are ≥2X probable toxicity, i.e. levels are 300
mg/dL at 4H post-ingestion, double the 2nd bag to 200 mg/kg over 16 hours.
Stopping IV NAC
At 18 hours into the NAC infusion (2 hours before completion), send bloods for:
Paracetamol level, ALT, Urea, electrolytes, creatinine.
The NAC infusion should be discontinued only when the:
- ALT < 50U/L, reached their peak levels and are declining
- Urea, electrolytes and creatinine are normal or have normalised (if previously
abnormal)
- Paracetamol level has returned to normal (i.e. below <10 mg/dL)
The 2nd bag over 16H may be repeated if there is ongoing hepatotoxicity at
completion of IV NAC at 20 hours and dosing adjusted to serum paracetamol (should
be <10 mg/dL at 20H).
